# Bit Trees and Braille
## Author
Rene Urias Jr.

### Project Description
This project involves creating a Java program that utilizes a binary tree structure to efficienlty store and convert mappings between Braille and other representations, such as ASCII and Unicode. The 'BitTree' class is designed to handle the conversion by representing Braille charatcters as binary strings and mapping them to corresponding ASCII or Unicode values. The project includes methods for setting mapiings, retrieving values, printing the tree contents, and loading mappings from external sources. The goal is to build a flexible and efficient system for learning and working with Braille representations in a programming context.
