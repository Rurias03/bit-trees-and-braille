# Bit Trees and Braille

## Author
Rene Urias Jr.

### Project Description
This Java program utilizes binary tree structures to efficiently store and convert mappings between Braille characters and other representations, including ASCII and Unicode. The 'BitTree' class is designed to handle the conversion by representing Braille characters as binary strings and mapping them to corresponding ASCII or Unicode values. The project includes methods for setting mappings, retrieving values, printing tree contents, and loading mappings from external sources. The goal is to build a flexible and efficient system for learning and working with Braille representations in a programming context.

## Resources Used

- **Online Java Documentation**: The official Java documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) was consulted to understand specific Java methods and classes, aiding in the implementation of the binary tree and related functionalities.
- **StackOverflow**: When encountering challenges in coding, such as issues with the `loadMapping` method, I sought solutions on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) for relevant examples and guidance.
- **Online Java Style Guide**: The Google Java Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) was referenced to maintain consistent formatting and adhere to naming conventions, contributing to improved code readability.
- **Online Markdown Guide**: The README.md file was crafted using an online Markdown guide (https://www.markdownguide.org/), providing essential information on Markdown syntax for effective and well-organized documentation.
